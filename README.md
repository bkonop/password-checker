# password-checker
Password change page that verifies new password meets certain criteria.

## Purpose
This project was started because my university's password change page has specific criteria with no indication of whether the criteria has actually been met or not.

## What I learned:
- Reinforced certain array and string methods
- Practiced writing more compact and efficient code
